          Born from the vision of three Gen Z trailblazers, we&apos;re not just
          another company, we are three bookworms united by a passion for
          literature and fueled by a collective dissatisfaction with the old
          norms of publishing.
          <br />
          <br />
          Our generation, shaped by the beauty of short, captivating content,
          started a seismic shift in content consumption and we decided to
          revolutionize the book industry to align with this new paradigm.
          <br />
          <br />
          Witnessing the fading allure of 500 page novels and the magnetic pull
          of bite-sized stories, we took action. Enter Short Form Books: our
          revolutionary response to a generational call. Dive in, and experience
          the future of reading.

          We believe in creating books that align with modern consumption habits
          while preserving the charm and depth of traditional reading. Short
          form books offer a compilation of short stories, each of which can be
          enjoyed in 15-20 minutes.
          <br />
          <br />
          It&apos;s the perfect balance for young readers seeking intriguing,
          quick-to-read stories without having to commit to a boring 500-page
          novel. We aim to make reading accessible, engaging, and appealing to a
          new generation of readers who live in a digital age characterized by
          instant gratification.
